# FibblyWhibbly

Fibonacci sequence and largest sum subarray program for CS 335.

# NOTE

This uses `tabulate` to print pretty looking tables.
If running under Linux, please use the following command sequence to properly test:

```bash
python3 -m venv virtual
source virtual/bin/activate
pip3 install tabulate # change to pip if not using Ubuntu, this program was written in Arch Linux (btw)
python3 main.py
deactivate
rm -rf virtual
```

The program will be menu based and each test that needs to be conducted will run when given the proper number.
